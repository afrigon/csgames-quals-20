# CSGames Qualifications 2020

## Coding

This is kind of a warmup track, try to make your solution as elegant and efficient as possible. Each Challenge is explained upon connection.

### Format

Provide your solutions source. Extra points for adding comments explaining your algorithm's complexity.

### Challenges

#### sorting

This one is simple, you are given a list of number, sort it then send it back our way.

```sh
nc csgames-quals.frigon.app 8100
```

#### palindrome

You'll be given a string, validate if it's a permutation of a palindrome or not. Do that a couple of times and you get the flag. Valid inputs are `True` and `False`.

```sh
nc csgames-quals.frigon.app 8101
```

#### ascii

For this one, you'll simply have to decode the ascii art and tell me what number it is. You can count to 1000, right?

```sh
nc csgames-quals.frigon.app 8102
```
