## Devops - Zulip

Welcome to devops challenge! 

Here's what you'll need to do: 

- Create a linux vm. You'll need docker and minikube on this vm. 1 way to do this is
to create a vagrantfile. You can read the docs here: 
    - https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/index.html
    - https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/
	- https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

- Write a Dockerfile for this app: https://github.com/zulip/zulip
- Deploy the app on minikube in your vm. You get bonus point if your deployement
handle load balancing and your apps use kubernetes storage classes.

You'll need to include all scripts and a README.md file explaining what I'd need to do
in order to replicate your setup. 

Good luck! Feel free to ask questions!
